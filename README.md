## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm **Gemson C. Andal** — or **Kuropii** online.  
I’m a systems thinker with a passion for building tools that make decision-making easier and smarter.

🎓 I created a **Senior High School Strand Recommendation System** for my thesis a project designed to help students choose the right SHS strand (like STEM, ABM, or HUMSS) based on personality, interests, and subject confidence. The system uses **weighted scoring logic**, **MBTI alignment**, and subject-based multipliers to generate compatibility scores for each strand. I built the system with **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Excel-style logic**.

💼 I currently work as a **Data Encoder**, but I've taken initiative to lead a purchasing system centralization project using **Power Query**, **Excel**, and **barcoding tools** improving traceability of ingredients and simplifying manual processes.

🛠 I’m self-learning:
- Power BI, SQL, PHP/MySQL
- Git & version control beyond just pushing
- Basics of automation and scripting

🧠 My approach is analytical and grounded I enjoy designing logical flows, automating processes, and making sense of messy data.
